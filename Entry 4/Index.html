<h1>Who doesn't want to be 100 years old someday?</h1>

<h2>
There are various studies that prove that one of the key elements for living a healthier and longer life is the food that you eat. Food is our source of survival and it has an important role in our culture, beliefs, and emotions. <br><br>
I've recently started this Nexflix Show by Dan Buettner called "Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones". In the series, Dan visits small communities around the world with the biggest concentration of people who live longer and healthier lives. I would really recommend checking it out :)

According to <em><a href=https://www.wellandgood.com/dan-buettner-longevity-foods/ /a> Dan's studies </em></a> of the Blue Zones, which food have these people been eating for centuries, and why are they good for you?</h2>

<h1>How does this relate to food design?</h1>

<h2>
Well, Food Design has to do with the whole experience of eating right? And having the knowledge of which foods influence our health is crucial. A restaurant owner, for example, has to know where each ingredient was harvested and how it got to their kitchen. The owner is also responsible for the impact this food has on the customers and should design the recipes accordingly. And that my friends, is what we call Food Design!</h2>
