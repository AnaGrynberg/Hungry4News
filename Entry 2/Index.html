<p><h4> LA few years ago I started thinking about my future profession and what was the 'right' path to be pursued. After hours of browsing through the university's websites and asking many questions to counselors, I was disappointed to find that nothing was making me excited. It ends up that I was looking for clothes in the supermarket if you know what I mean. </p></h4>
<p> <h4> As someone once said 'the best things in life come unexpectedly'. One day I was looking back at my past documents and I found a very odd text I had written for some art class, where I mentioned two names, that even though were labeled as my main inspirations, I had no idea who they wereâ€¦ One of them was Francesca Zampollo, a Food Designer, teacher, consultant, and founder of the OSFD (Oline School of Food Design). Francesca has dedicated 20 years of her life to Food Design, learning, creating, and teaching. Just like Francesca, I'm here to share with you some of my findings and perhaps, make you look differently at  your slice of pizza ; ) </h4></p>

<h5 id="anagut"> <em> Topics Explored at the <a href=https://onlineschooloffooddesign.org/ /a> OSFD </a></em></h5>
<br>
<p><h4> As you can see above, there is a whole universe around Food Design and so much you can explore. After completing some of the courses available in the OSFD, I immersed, myself in this world and found more interesting creators to be inspired by. Marije Vogelzang, a Dutch Food Designer, was one of them. She is interested in how people design their food habits, ways, and rituals. Marije also explores some amazing food and pycology topics (which we will talk about later : ) and ways we could use creativity as a vehicle for change. She is the founder of the <em><a href=https://thedifd.com//a> Dutch Institute of Food Design </a></em> and created the first Food Design award.</p></h4>

<p><h4> I found the Food Design community that already exists but perhaps doesn't identify itself as a Food Designer. Here are some other great designers, chefs, and photographers who inspired me in this journey and hopefully will get you thinking!</p></h4>
